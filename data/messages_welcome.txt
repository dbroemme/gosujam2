Your goal is to clear as many bricks as you can, collect as many
dots as you can, and get your ball into the green exit area
before the walls or fire come crashing in on you. Don't let your
ball fall through into the fire.

Start:  Space bar to launch your ball
          A/D to move launch angle left/right
          W/S to speed up or slow down the launch 

Play:   A - move left
          D - move right
          Space bar - increase ball speed
